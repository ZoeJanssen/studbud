__Assignment Overview__

I found this assignment to be very enjoyable and a fun challenge. It was a lot more difficult to use github than repplit at the start, espically as i didn't clear my cache, so was confused and kept changing my nav bar as i was unable to see an outcome from my changes. I feel a lot more confident with coding, and feel like i have a greater understanding overall of all three languages but particularly the use of javascript in Web design. It is a bit of challenge when you can't find the missing semicolons but in the end it all went okay. 

## development documentation
 __Changes__ There were various changes that came about from my inital mockups, particularly as i can design a great website but can not always code it. Although i did change a lot up, it was generally a cosmetic change and did not effect the user experience. 
 * __Removed the Profile Page__
    * I did actually code this page but at the end of the day i realised it did not add anything to the design and hence was deemed unnecessary. You can see below the inital designed Porfile page:

    * And the coded Profile Page:

 * __Workspace overview__
     * There were many changes that came about from my workspace, i removed the page that contained multiple different study boards and just choose to have the overall study board as i re-designed it to only be features that can benefit creative students.
     * I re designed the workspace feautures many times to ensure that the features made sense within their environment. I also re designed the layout for the workspace as it was extremly difficult to create the grid structure i wanted aswell as being responsive therefore i choose to do equal boxes, but i actually think this looks cleaner and more put together.
     * I removed the changing background as the header and moved it to its own div, and made buttons that changed the colour of the background, as i wanted my design to be accessible to everyone and if i was uploading multiple images this would slow down the efficiency of my website
     * I also changed the features around and utilised a colour generator, acronym generator, background colour changer, stop watch, pomodoro and music player
     * I constantly was re-designing this page to allow for more efficent type spent coding in stead of wasting time with thinking how it would be layout

* __Resource List__
    * I removed this page as i changed features from Reading list to Acronym generator as i felt that it would be more beneficial to a creative mind to use acronyms then have a reading list 

* __Task Page__
    * I re designed this page to include the task list itself and form to make it easier for the user to access the Kanban Board 
    * I made the descision to not include an adding of a column as the origianl Kanban board is suppose to be in three columns as it makes for a more structured output for tasks
